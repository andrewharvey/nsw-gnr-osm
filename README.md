# About
Tools to help turn the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales (GNB) [Geographical Names Register (GNR)](http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/place_naming/placename_search) into an OSM like schema in the GeoJSON and OSM format.

Skip the build and use the pre-built [gnr.osm](https://github.com/andrewharvey/nsw-gnr-osm/blob/master/dist/gnr.osm) or [gnr.osm.geojson](https://github.com/andrewharvey/nsw-gnr-osm/blob/master/dist/gnr.osm.geojson).
